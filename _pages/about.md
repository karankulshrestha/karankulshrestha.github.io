I am a Full Stack AI Engineer at Go India Advisor and a final-year Computer Science student at Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College. My work focuses on building production-ready AI systems, particularly in the domains of generative AI and agentic systems.

Currently, I am developing Stock GPT, an advanced agentic AI assistant that processes financial data from multiple sources including broker reports, earnings transcripts, and quarterly filings. The system integrates over 27 SQL tables and employs sophisticated multi-tool calling mechanisms. Through implementing robust credit systems and monitoring with Langfuse, we achieved a 50% increase in paid user engagement.

My technical expertise spans the full AI development lifecycle, from model deployment to infrastructure optimization. I have built cost-efficient GPU-powered systems for document processing, achieving 95% accuracy in extracting visual data from financial reports. I work extensively with technologies like TypeScript, Next.js, Python, and various vector databases including Typesense and Pinecone.

During my internship at Bobble AI, I gained hands-on experience with content generation pipelines, deployed multiple opensource models including Hunyuan and SDXL, and developed data scraping infrastructure for training computer vision models. I also contributed to reverse engineering background removal techniques from opensource implementations.

Beyond my professional work, I am an active participant in the tech community. I have won seven hackathons, including a $3,400 prize from DTDL, a German Telekom company. I have contributed to opensource projects at Y-Combinator backed startups and founded Grabup, a startup venture during my college years that taught me valuable lessons about entrepreneurship and building products from scratch.

I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in practical applications, with a particular interest in agentic systems, financial technology, and scalable infrastructure design.
