I am a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Lovely Professional University, Punjab, with a strong foundation in software development and data analysis. My academic journey has been complemented by practical experience through internships at Celebal Technologies and Unified Mentor, where I worked on data analytics and Java development projects.

My technical expertise spans across multiple programming languages including Java, Python, and C++, with hands-on experience in web development using Spring Boot and modern web technologies. I have developed several full-stack applications, including an inventory management system and an e-commerce platform, demonstrating my ability to build end-to-end solutions.

During my internship at Celebal Technologies, I specialized in creating interactive Power BI dashboards and conducting data analysis using SQL to drive business insights. My experience at Unified Mentor allowed me to strengthen my backend development skills, working with RESTful APIs and database integration.

I am passionate about problem-solving and continuously expanding my knowledge in algorithms, data structures, and system design. I enjoy taking on challenging projects that allow me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world applications. Currently, I am exploring opportunities in software development where I can contribute to building scalable and efficient solutions.
